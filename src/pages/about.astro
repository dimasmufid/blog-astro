            My Career Journey
          </h5>
          <p>
            I don't have any technical background when I started my career. In my journey of getting management degree, I meet statistics and interested on it. That is the tipping point for me to start my career in data field, starting as a Data Analyst in <Link href="https://entrefine.com/" external>entrefine</Link>, a consultant startup that help a small and medium enterprise to optimize data for their business growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there is a point where one of the client have a large amount of data that need to be process. In that point, I learn anything about data warehouse in <Link href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery" external>BigQuery</Link> and also my first meet with <Link href="https://airflow.apache.org/" external>Airflow</Link> for building ELT data pipeline. So my data engineering learning journey is even I learn it accidentally. But apparently, it is become the field that I love the most to work with.
          </p>
          <p>
            But unfortunately, the output of data engineering is data infrastructure. It is not something that will face directly into the end user. That is the point where then I start learning about web development. Big thanks to <Link href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" external>the odin project</Link> for providing free and comprehensive web development curriculum. That later I learn more about <Link href="https://nextjs.org/" external>nextjs</Link> and <Link href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" external>fastapi</Link> that become my main weapon for building software system.
