Most Indonesian marketplace sellers think they’re growing.

They open Shopee, Tokopedia, TikTok Shop dashboards…  
See the GMV line going up…  
And feel safe.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth:

> **If your only source of truth is the marketplace dashboard, you’re running your business half-blind. You see the GMV. But you don’t see the margin.**

And margin is where most marketplace businesses quietly die.

## **Why "GMV Growth" Means Nothing**

Every marketplace dashboard is engineered for one thing:

**Push sellers to chase more GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume).**

So it hides the one thing that actually matters to your business:

**Profitability.**

Here’s what Indonesian sellers experience every month — but only notice too late:

### **1. Ads scale faster than profit**  
In every marketplace:

- Add more ads → GMV increases  
- GMV increases → admin fee increases too  
- But profit?  
  *Usually flat, sometimes negative.*

Marketplace ads are built like fuel injectors — they increase traffic, not efficiency.  
If your margin is already thin, ads just accelerate the loss.

### **2. Admin fees quietly rise with GMV**  
This is the most painful, most ignored truth.

Admin fee is proportional.  
So when your GMV increases, your fee automatically increases — even if your margin stays the same.

That means:

**You can grow 30% in GMV and still earn LESS money.**

This happens more often than sellers want to admit.

## **The Real Enemy: Fragmented, Incomplete Data**

Every seller in Indonesia faces the same structural problem:

**Marketplace dashboards only show the “happy” data.  
Finance systems show the “painful” data.  
But they are never connected.**

So here’s what keeps happening:

- Marketplace team reports "GMV increases"  
- Finance reports "profit decreases"  
- Owner sees it one month late  
- No one knows exactly which fee caused it  
- Everyone keeps guessing  
- Business slowly bleeds  
- They only catch the problem after the burn is big

And the worst part?

All the silent killers are scattered across different tabs, reports, and exports:

- Admin fee  
- Commission  
- Shipping subsidy  
- Cashback  
- Voucher cost  
- Promo contribution  
- Ads  
- Refund/return penalties

Every fee looks small.  
But stacked across platforms, across thousands of orders?

It’s brutal.

## **The Illusion of Growth**

Here’s the reality most sellers don’t want to hear:

**You can be “growing” every month and still be less healthy than you were 6 months ago.**

Because growth in marketplaces is not intuitive.

Your GMV grows visually.  
Your profit shrinks invisibly.

It’s like driving a car that shows your speedometer…  
…but hides your fuel gauge.

Most sellers find out they’re low on fuel only after the engine sputters.

## **The Wake-Up Call**

The moment sellers finally connect all three lines:

- **GMV**
- **Total cost**
- **Profit**

…it becomes obvious what happened.

Maybe ads quietly doubled.  
Maybe admin fee ate the margin.  
Maybe promo stack was too aggressive.  
Maybe blended ROAS was unsustainable.  
Maybe certain SKUs were fundamentally unprofitable.

Once the data sits in one place, truth becomes unavoidable.

And most sellers don’t like the truth at first.

But it saves their business.

## **If You Only Look at the Marketplace Dashboard…**

…I’ll be blunt:

**You’re margin-blind.**

And margin-blind sellers eventually pay the most expensive tuition fee —  
not to mentors, not to consultants,  
but to the marketplace itself.
