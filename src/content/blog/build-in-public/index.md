If you’d told me a year ago I’d be documenting my startup journey online, I would’ve laughed. Like a lot of people heads-down in tech, I spent years quietly building, failing, and learning—without much sharing.

But recently, I picked up Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon, and something clicked. The idea that your journey, even in its messy, unfinished state, could be valuable to others. That resonated with me.

So here I am, launching this blog to share both the stumbles and the sparks as I build, learn, and (hopefully) grow.

## Why I Started—The Power of Sharing

The culture around startups and technology often celebrates overnight success, but that’s not the reality I know. Most of the value is in the process—the nights iterating on a tricky model, the bug that makes you want to throw your laptop, the tiny breakthrough that makes the struggle worth it.

Austin Kleon’s book was a simple but powerful nudge: Don’t wait until you have the finished product. Share your process as you go. I wish I’d found that advice sooner, so—here we are. My goal is twofold:

Document the rollercoaster of building my AI startup (failures included)
Share the research and learning that gets me through it, for anyone walking the same path

## Building Nesra

Right now, my biggest project is building my own startup, called Nesra. It is an AI Lab that focus building digital product that focus on **Data Analytics and AI**. I build Nesra with my partner. With me that focus on engineering part while my partner is very strong business part, we hope we could contibute more to the society.

## Learning Journey

Other than me that currently building my own startup, I also currently learning for my future that will focus more on Research Scientist on AI and hopefully robotics. In this blog, I will also write about my learning journey, that is related with `Mathematics`, `Computer Science`, `AI`, and `Robotics`.

## Conclusion: Let’s Build in Public

So, this is my first public step toward showing my work—successes, failures, and everything between. If you’re another founder, researcher, builder, or just curious about AI and technology, I’d love to connect. Share your thoughts in the comments, send me a message, or just say hi.

I’m not an expert (yet!), but I am a builder, a learner, and now—a sharer. Thanks for stopping by. Let’s build something great—out in the open.
