## The Ending Only Matters Because of the Journey

Today I watched the last episode of *My Hero Academia*.

It left me quiet for a while.

Not hyped. Not excited.
But grateful. Grounded. Meaningful.

Because the ending only worked for one reason:
**I remembered how far Deku had to go to get there.**

### He Started With Nothing — And Still Chose to Move

Deku didn’t start strong.
He didn’t start talented.
He didn’t even start *qualified*.

In a world where almost everyone had a quirk, he had **none**.

No power.
No shortcut.
No hidden advantage.

Just a fragile body, notebooks full of observations, and a stubborn desire to help others anyway.

Most people would’ve accepted reality at that point.
He didn’t.

He trained his body even when it felt pointless.
He showed up even when he knew he would lose.
He kept moving forward **without any guarantee** that it would pay off.

That part matters more than people admit.

### Power Didn’t Save Him — It Only Raised the Cost

When Deku finally received *One For All*, the story could’ve ended there.

Chosen one.
Legendary power.
Problem solved.

But it didn’t.

Because the power was **too much** for him.

Every fight broke his body.
Every punch shattered his bones.
Every victory came with pain, fear, and consequences.

He wasn’t cocky.
He wasn’t satisfied.
He wasn’t comfortable.

He kept asking:

> “How can I use this without destroying myself?”

Growth didn’t come from power.
It came from **learning restraint, patience, and responsibility**.

Sometimes progress meant winning.
Sometimes it meant choosing not to fight.
Sometimes it meant sacrificing his own future for one more chance to protect someone else.

That’s not glamorous.
That’s heavy.

### Becoming a Hero Cost Him More Than Strength

Deku didn’t just sacrifice comfort.
He sacrificed safety.
He sacrificed certainty.
He sacrificed parts of himself.

There were moments when being a hero meant:

* standing alone,
* carrying guilt,
* pushing forward while injured,
* choosing the harder path again and again.

And still — he kept going.

Not because it was fun.
Not because it was easy.
But because it aligned with who he wanted to become.

By the time he reached the end, the title “greatest hero” didn’t feel exaggerated.

It felt **earned**.

### The Same Truth in *The Alchemist*
That’s why *The Alchemist* came back to me.

Santiago’s treasure was never really about gold.

In the end, it was right where he started.

But imagine if he found it immediately.

No desert.
No loss.
No fear.
No sacrifice.

It would’ve meant nothing.

The treasure mattered **because**:

* he crossed continents,
* he lost what he loved,
* he doubted himself,
* he suffered for the journey.

The journey transformed him.
The treasure only confirmed it.

### Why This Matters to Me — Right Now

This is the reminder I needed.

If you only look at the ending:

* success feels shallow,
* achievement feels empty,
* results feel accidental.

But when you know the struggle behind it, everything changes.

The pain.
The waiting.
The boredom.
The moments where quitting would’ve been reasonable.

That’s where meaning is built.

### A Quiet Reminder

Don’t rush the ending.
Don’t skip the hard parts.
Don’t underestimate the days where nothing seems to move.

Those days are doing the real work.

Because when you finally arrive —
what will matter most
is not *what you got*…

but **who you became on the way there**.
