## The Ending Only Matters Because of the Journey

Today I watched the last episode of *My Hero Academia*.

It hit harder than I expected.

Not because the ending was grand.
But because I remembered **everything it took to get there** — the failures, the fear, the sacrifices, the moments where quitting would’ve made sense.

Without that journey, the ending would’ve been… empty.

That feeling reminded me of *The Alchemist*.

Different medium. Same truth.

The story isn’t really about reaching the treasure.
It’s about **who you become while chasing it**.

### Why the Ending Alone Is Never Enough

If you only look at the final result:

* Success looks lucky.
* Victory looks simple.
* Achievement looks obvious.

But that’s a lie.

The result only feels meaningful because:

* You know what was risked.
* You understand what was sacrificed.
* You’ve seen how many times things almost broke.

Remove the struggle, and the reward becomes plain.

That’s why shortcuts don’t inspire anyone.
That’s why overnight success stories feel hollow.
That’s why copying outcomes never works.

### The Lie We Tell Ourselves About “The Process”

People love to say *“trust the process.”*

But most of the time, they don’t really mean it.

What they mean is:

> “I’ll endure the process **as long as I get the ending**.”

The moment progress feels slow, boring, lonely, or uncertain — doubt creeps in.

But the process isn’t a waiting room.
It’s the **actual point**.

The journey is where:

* your values are tested,
* your discipline is built,
* your identity is formed.

The destination just proves it happened.

### The Real Lesson I Took Away

Heroes aren’t admired because they win.

They’re admired because:

* we know what it cost,
* we saw the struggle,
* we walked the journey with them.

If you only show the outcome, people see luck.
If you show the journey, people see **truth**.

That’s what makes stories powerful.
That’s what makes achievements meaningful.
That’s what makes life feel full.

### A Reminder to Myself (and Maybe You)

Don’t rush the ending.
Don’t hide the messy middle.
Don’t measure progress only by results.

The meaning is being built **right now**, quietly, in the process.

And one day, when you finally arrive,
it won’t feel empty —
because you’ll know exactly what it took to get there.
