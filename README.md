# Dimas Mufid — Blog

This repo powers my personal blog and build journal. I'm a data engineer who got tired of watching business teams wait on dashboards, so I'm building **Mark**, an AI business analyst that turns messy data into clear answers. I write here to share the process, the detours, and the lessons learned.

## What you'll find
- Build-in-public logs for Mark: from the [first pitch](/blog/mark-project) to the [agentic experiments](/blog/mark-agentic-plan) and [tech stack shifts](/blog/mark-tech-stack-change) as I figure out how to ship a reliable AI analyst.
- Notes from shipping: weekly evaluations, learning logs, and the messy middle of deciding what to cut or double down on.
- Data/AI engineering practice: BigQuery, FastAPI + Next.js, and patterns for turning raw data into narratives and visuals.
- Occasional stories from consulting at Entrefine and why I still prefer building scrappy, end-to-end systems.

## Tech stack
- [Astro 5](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Markdown/MDX content living in `src/content`
- RSS feed and sitemap generated out of the box
